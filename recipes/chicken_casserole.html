    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Chicken casserole is the quintessential "one-pot" comfort meal, designed to be 
        both hearty and soul-warming. It typically features tender bite-sized pieces of 
        chicken combined with a creamy base—often made from a bechamel sauce or a savory 
        mushroom or chicken soup. To add texture and color, the dish is usually packed 
        with vegetables like broccoli, peas, or carrots and bulked up with egg noodles, 
        rice, or sliced potatoes.

        <li>Sauce: 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup milk
        <li>Vegetables: 2 cups chopped broccoli florets or frozen peas and carrots

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F. In a large mixing bowl, combine the shredded 
        chicken, cooked noodles or rice, and your choice of vegetables. 
        <li>In a separate smaller bowl, whisk together the cream soup, sour cream, milk, 
        and seasonings until smooth, then fold this mixture into the chicken and starch until 
        everything is well-coated.
        <li>Transfer the mixture into a greased baking dish and spread it out evenly. 
        <li>Top with a generous layer of shredded cheese and the buttered cracker 
        crumbs. 
        <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes until the sauce is bubbling and the topping has 
        turned a golden brown. 
        <li>Let it rest for five minutes before serving.
