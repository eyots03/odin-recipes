    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        A classic roast chicken is a testament to the power of simple, high-quality 
        ingredients. A whole chicken is seasoned—often with just butter, salt, pepper,
        and aromatics like lemon, garlic, and rosemary—and roasted at a high temperature. 
        The goal is to achieve a golden-brown, crackling skin while keeping the meat
        underneath tender and succulent.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Main: 1 whole chicken (4–5 lbs), patted dry
        <li>Fat: 4 tbsp softened unsalted butter or olive oil
        <li>Aromatics: 1 halved lemon, 1 head of garlic, 1 small yellow onion
        <li>Herbs: Fresh sprigs of rosemary, thyme, and sage
        <li>Seasoning: Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
        <li>Vegetable Bed: 1 lb baby potatoes, 3 large carrots, 2 stalks celery
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F. Pat the chicken very dry with paper towels, as moisture 
        on the skin prevents crisping. 
        <li>Stuff the cavity with the lemon, garlic, onion, and fresh herbs. 
        <li>Rub the softened butter or oil all over the outside of the bird and season 
        extremely generously with salt and pepper.
        <li>Place the chopped root vegetables in the bottom of a roasting pan and 
        nestle the chicken on top of them. 
        <li>Roast for 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the juices run clear 
        and the thigh temperature reaches 165°F. 
        <li>Let the chicken rest for at least 15 minutes before carving to allow the 
        juices to redistribute through the meat.
    </ol>
