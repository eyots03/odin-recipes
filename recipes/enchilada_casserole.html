    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This dish is a "lazy" version of traditional rolled enchiladas, often referred 
        to as a Mexican lasagna. It features layers of corn tortillas, seasoned shredded 
        chicken or ground beef, and plenty of gooey melted cheese. Everything is bound 
        together by a rich, savory red or green chili sauce and baked until the edges are 
        bubbly and crisp.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Protein: 1 lb ground beef or shredded chicken seasoned with taco spices
        <li>Starch: 10–12 corn tortillas cut into strips or layers
        <li>Sauce: 2 cups red or green enchilada sauce
        <li>Vegetables: 1 can black beans, 1 cup corn kernels, 1 small diced onion
        <li>Dairy: 3 cups shredded Monterey Jack or Mexican blend cheese
        <li>Garnish: Fresh cilantro, sour cream, and sliced green onions
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F. Brown the ground meat in a skillet over medium 
        heat, draining any excess fat before stirring in the onions, beans, corn, and taco 
        seasoning. 
        <li>Pour a small amount of enchilada sauce into the bottom of a 9x13 baking 
        dish to prevent sticking, then create a base layer using corn tortilla pieces.
        <li>Spread half of the meat mixture over the tortillas, top with more sauce, 
        and add a layer of cheese. 
        <li>Repeat these layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a heavy 
        layer of cheese on top. 
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for 
        another 10 minutes to melt the cheese completely. 
        <li>Top with fresh cilantro and sour cream.
    </ol>
