    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Meatloaf is the ultimate home-style comfort food, consisting of ground meat—usually 
        a blend of beef, pork, or veal—mixed with binders like breadcrumbs and eggs. 
        To keep it juicy and flavorful, diced onions, celery, and herbs are folded into
        the mix. It is typically shaped into a loaf and baked, often topped with a tangy
        tomato-based glaze or ketchup that caramelizes in the oven.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: 2 lbs ground beef
        <li>Binders: 1 cup breadcrumbs, 2 large eggs, 1/4 cup whole milk
        <li>Aromatics: 1 small finely diced onion, 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
        <li>Glaze: 1/2 cup ketchup, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp yellow mustard
        <li>Seasoning: 1 tsp dried parsley, salt, and cracked black pepper
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, 
        eggs, milk, diced onions, garlic, and seasonings. 
        <li>Use your hands to mix gently until just combined; overmixing can lead to a 
        tough, dense loaf. 
        <li>Shape the mixture into a rectangular loaf and place it on a foil-lined 
        baking sheet or in a loaf pan.
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard to 
        create the glaze. 
        <li>Spread about two-thirds of the glaze over the top of the meatloaf. 
        <li>Bake for 45 minutes, then apply the remaining glaze and bake for another 
        15 minutes. 
        <li>Ensure the internal temperature reaches 160°F before removing from the 
        oven and resting for 10 minutes.
    </ol>
